# Roadmap

As said in the overview, productivity is the first priority of this project, so the metadata related API will be implemented first to make prototyping and testing easier. Then, I will consider functional APIs.

###### Action List

* ~~Implement device management API from HAL~~
* Implement register read/write API
* Add metadata to use register read/write API
* Complete setup.py script to cover different systems
* Add Numpy extension for the performance of functional API
* Apply Numpy extension to buffer management API
* Add protobuf extension
* Add support for kernel execution API (might use protobuf)
* Refactor code using protobuf support
